### Personal Statement on Project

I double-checked all the connections and made sure there were no loose wires or short circuits. Then, I uploaded the code to the Raspberry Pi Pico and gave the circuit a test run.
Unfortunately, the Tesla coil didn't work. After some digging, I found out the problem was with the materials I used. The thinner copper wire I used for the primary coil just wasn't right for the job. Plus, the PVC pipe was too short and the coil wasn't wound tightly enough.
Even though it didn't work out this time, I learned a lot. Now I know that I need to use the right wire and make sure the coil is wound properly. I'll try again in the future, but for now, that's it for this project.
