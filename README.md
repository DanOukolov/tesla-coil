### Long Term Vision 
I want to build an EMR and Medical Office experience that is heavily reliant on patients taking charge of their own documentation with the help of AI and the use of HL7 FHIR to track patient docs and data. This portion of my project provides a proof of concept that microphones can track coversations successfully. These conversations can then be passed to Chat GPT to structure and turn them into medical notes.

### Personal Statement on Project
This project serves as the absolute basic of an automated medical encounter note. 


Automation for Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) in the medical field is essential to improve the quality of patient care, reduce medical errors, and streamline administrative tasks. EMRs contain vital information about a patient's medical history, diagnosis, and treatment plan, which must be easily accessible by medical professionals at all times. However, the manual handling of paper records can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and difficult to maintain.
Automation of EMRs can help healthcare providers to quickly access accurate patient information and make informed decisions. This can lead to better patient outcomes, improved efficiency, and reduced healthcare costs. EMR automation can also help to reduce the risk of medical errors, such as misdiagnosis, incorrect medication dosage, or missed allergies, by providing instant access to updated patient information.

My goal as an entrepreneur will be to eliminate these inefficiencies.
